This program was made to estimate the correct answer to a game made by a Youtuber named Primer. In the game you have a limited number of coin flips possible total and you can use as many of them as you want to determine 
the correct answer for any given coin flipper. 50% of flippers have a fair coin and 50% have a coin that have a 75% chance of coming up heads. If you get the answer correct you get 15 coins back. If you're wrong, you lose
30 coins.  This script will calculate the chance that each combination is coming from a liar and print all those results to a file.

The game link appears to just be the front page of the youtuber's website, so it's likely this link will not work forever.
